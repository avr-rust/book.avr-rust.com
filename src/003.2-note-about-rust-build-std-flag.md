# 3.2. A note about the required Rust `-Z build-std=<CRATE,>` flag

AVR-Rust is not distributed with a pre-built libcore crate. Instead, it is compiled on-demand when a crate uses it via the Rust `-Z build-std` flag.

There are many hundreds of variants of AVR microcontroller, and it is not feasible to distribute runtime libraries for all of them within a regular Rust distribution.

Due to this, any time a crate is built for AVR, `-Z build-std=core` should be passed to `cargo`.

## Example

```bash
cargo build -Z build-std=core --target avr-atmega328p.json --release
```

## What happens if you don't pass it

Then you will get a "cannot find crate for 'core'" error when you compile the crate. The only crates that can
avoid this are those that are `#[no_core]` crates, such as `libcore` itself.

# 5.3. Creating an executable entry point with `#[no_main]`

The standard Rust AVR toolchain will use AVR-GCC's linker and chip-specific startup runtime libraries.
Due to this, it is necessary to override Rust's default behaviour for the main function and instead
write one that looks exactly like a AVR-GCC C/C++ main function so that the regular AVR-GCC libraries
will link to it correctly.

To define a `main` function for AVR:

  * Add the `#![no_main]` attribute to the top of the crate root (`src/main.rs`)
  * Add a custom `main` function callable from C that will be picked up by AVR-GCC's startup libraries

```rust
// src/main.rs

#![no_std] // from the previous step
#![no_main]

#[no_mangle]
pub extern fn main() {
}
```

Notes:

  * The `#![no_main]` attribute tells Rust to skip its usual expectations on the main function, instead
    letting the developer manually handle it. In the usual case for AVR, the target specification JSON file
    will link startup files from AVR-GCC and thus the ABI of the Rust `main` function must match that
    of the of AVR-GCC startup files.
  * These steps can be applied to any executable within a crate, including those in the `examples/` directory
    for a library and those injected via `[[bin]]` attributes in the `Cargo.toml`.

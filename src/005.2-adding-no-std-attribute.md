# 5.2. Adding the `#[no_std]` attribute to your crate

As an embedded target with no operating system, many faculties that the Rust
standard library requires are not and could not be supported on AVR.

Because of this, only `#[no_std]` crates may be compiled for AVR.

```rust
// src/main.rs or src/lib.rs

#![no_std]

fn my_function() {
    // ...
}

// ...
```

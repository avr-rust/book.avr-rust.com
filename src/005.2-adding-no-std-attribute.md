## Adding `#[no_std]`

As an embedded target with no operating system, many faculties that the Rust
standard library requires are not and could not be supported on AVR.

Because of this, only `#[no_std]` crates may be compiled for AVR.

```rust
// src/main.rs or src/lib.rs

#![no_std]

fn my_function() {
    // ...
}

// ...
```

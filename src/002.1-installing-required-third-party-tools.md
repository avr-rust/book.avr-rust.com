# 2.1. Installing required third party tools


A number of third party tools are required to use AVR Rust.

* avr-gcc (only used as a linker frontend)
* avr-binutils (for linker support)
* avr-libc (for device-specific runtime libraries)
* avrdude (for flashing a real AVR chip)

These should be installed by the operating system package manager.

## Arch Linux

To install all required dependencies under Arch Linux, run

```bash
sudo pacman -S avr-gcc avr-libc avrdude
```

## Ubuntu

To install all required dependencies under Ubuntu Linux, run

```bash
sudo apt-get install binutils gcc-avr avr-libc avrdude
```

## macOS

Set up the [homebrew-avr][] tap, then install the packages:

```bash
brew install avr-binutils avr-gcc avrdude
```

Note that `avrdude` may be installed without the homebrew-avr tap.

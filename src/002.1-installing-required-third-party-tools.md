# 2.1. Installing required third party tools


A number of third party tools are required to use AVR Rust.

* avr-gcc (only used as a linker frontend)
* avr-binutils (for linker support)
* avr-libc (for device-specific runtime libraries)
* avrdude (for flashing a real AVR chip)

These should be installed by the operating system package manager.

## Arch Linux

To install all required dependencies under Arch Linux, run

```bash
sudo pacman -S avr-gcc avr-libc avrdude
```

## Ubuntu

To install all required dependencies under Ubuntu Linux, run

```bash
sudo apt-get install binutils gcc-avr avr-libc avrdude
```

## Linux

If your distrobution's package manager doesn't provide these tools, you can install them manually.

### AVR Toolchain

The AVR toolchain is necessary for compilation, and can be downloaded for several platforms from the manufacturer's website:

https://www.microchip.com/mplab/avr-support/avr-and-arm-toolchains-c-compilers

Once you uncompress the tar.gz for your system, add the subdirectory `{platform}/bin` to your PATH.  For example, if you uncompressed the archive to `~/Downloads/avr8-gnu-toolchain-3.6.2.1759-linux.any.x86_64/`, then you'd add this to your `.bashrc` file:

```bash
PATH=$PATH:$HOME/Downloads/avr8-gnu-toolchain-3.6.2.1759-linux.any.x86_64/avr8-gnu-toolchain-linux_x86_64/bin/
```

### AVRDUDE

AVRDUDE is necessary to flash your compiled binary to an AVR chip.  It can be downloaded from the project website:

http://download.savannah.gnu.org/releases/avrdude/

Download and uncompress the latest version for your system, and follow the instructions in the `INSTALL` file.

## macOS

Set up the [homebrew-avr][] tap, then install the packages:

```bash
brew install avr-binutils avr-gcc avrdude
```

Note that `avrdude` may be installed without the homebrew-avr tap.

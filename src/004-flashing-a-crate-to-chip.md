# 4. Flashing a crate to a real AVR chip


The [AVRDUDE](https://www.nongnu.org/avrdude/) utility is recommended for flashing the final ELF file to a physical AVR microcontroller.

Flashing a Rust ELF file is no different to flashing a regular AVR-GCC C/C++ generated ELF file.

Better instructions, including an example showing the flashing of the LED blink program to an Arduino UNO, will be added to this guide in the future.

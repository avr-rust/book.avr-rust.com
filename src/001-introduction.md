# 1. Introduction

[AVR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmel_AVR) is a type of low-frequency (sub-20MHz in general) 8-bit microcontroller developed by Atmel and owned by Microchip.

The AVR-Rust project aims to add support to the [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) ecosystem so that executables can be generated for AVR, taking
advantage of Rust's safety guarantees and ergonomics.

The following book describes what you need to know to use Rust with AVR support.
